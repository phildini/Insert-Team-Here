django-registration-defaults
============================

James Bennet's `django-registration <http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/>`_ 
is awesome.  But it doesn't come with any of the 15 templates required to
implement the workflow of registration, login/logout, and password changing and
resetting.  This application simply provides a set of default templates for
this to avoid the repetition of rewriting them.

This app is supplemental to ``django-registration``, which must also be
installed.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install using your preferred method for python modules.  The folder
``registration_defaults`` must end up in your python path.  You could do this
by copying or symlinking the folder into your path, or with::

    python setup.py install

My preferred method (and that of many django developers) is to install from the
git source using `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ with `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.  The `requirements file
<http://pip.openplans.org/#requirements-files>`_ entry for this (and the
dependency ``django-registration``) is as follows::

    django-registration
    -e git://github.com/yourcelf/django-registration-defaults.git#egg=django-registration-defaults

Setup
~~~~~

Configuration parameters required by ``django-registration`` are set in the
module ``registration_defaults.settings``.  Add these by importing them into
your settings file::

    from registration_defaults.settings import *

You can add the templates in one of two ways:

    1.  If you're using the ``django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader``
        template loader (it is enabled by default), you can include the
        templates by adding ``"registration_defaults"`` to your project's
        ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.  Keep in mind that ``admin`` defines some
        templates for changing and retrieving passwords, so if you want to use
        consistent base templates and styling for all registration and
        login/logout functions, you should add ``registration_defaults`` before
        ``django.contrib.admin`` so that it will take precedence::

            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                "registration_defaults",
                "django.contrib.admin",
                ...
                "registration",
            )

    2. Alternatively, if ``django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader`` is
       listed before the app directories loader, you can add
       ``REGISTRATION_TEMPLATE_DIR`` to your ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting.  If you
       do this, it is not necessary to include ``registration_defaults`` as an
       installed app::

            from registration_defaults.settings import *

            TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
                ...
                REGISTRATION_TEMPLATE_DIR,
            )

Base templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All ``registration_defaults`` templates inherit from
``registration/registration_base.html``.  The default template provided for
this is simply::

    {% extends "base.html" %}

You must either provide a ``base.html`` for the registration templates to
inherit from, or override ``registration/registration_base.html``.  The base
template should provide a ``title`` block for the content of the HTML title,
and a ``content`` block for content (NOTE: this has changed from previously
using ``body`` to be more in line with `reusable app standards 
<http://django-reusable-app-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ ).  For example::

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>
